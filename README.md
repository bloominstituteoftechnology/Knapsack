# Knapsack

![xkcd "NP-Complete"](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/np_complete.png "General solutions get you a 50% tip.")

Suppose you are Indiana Jones, and you have found the secret entrance to the the
Temple of Doom. Before you is a multitude of artifacts and treasures - pots,
gemstones, works of art, and more. These belong in a museum! But there are
soldiers hot on your heels, and you can only carry so much...

You, brave explorer, are facing the knapsack problem - maximizing the value of
a set of items you select that are constrained by total size/weight. The size
and the value of an item need not be correlated - the most precious item may be
a tiny gemstone. But it turns out it's pretty tricky to get a truly optimal
solution, and that a bruteforce approach really doesn't scale.

A bit more motivation - this ios a very general optimization problem that can be
applied in a multitude of situations, from resource selection and allocation to
stuffing stolen goods in knapsacks.

## Audience and Purpose

Audience: students and algorithms enthusiasts

* Try to solve a hard algorithmic puzzle
* Try a variety of algorithmic approaches
* Learn about performance/benchmarking, play with some actual data

## Getting started

The specific goal of this exercise is to write a program that takes input files
that look like this:

```
1 42 81
2 42 42
3 68 56
4 68 25
5 77 14
6 57 63
7 17 75
8 19 41
9 94 19
10 34 12
```

The first row number is just a row/observation number, to facilitate reading and
referring to items. The second number is the size/cost of the item, i.e. the
cost of putting it in your knapsack. The third number is the value, i.e. the
utility/payoff you get for selecting that item. The program should also take as
input a total size, which can just be a number passed from the command line. So
execution may look like this: `./knapsack input.txt --threshold=100`

The goal is to select a subset of the items to maximize the payoff such that the
cost is below some threshold. That is, the output should be a set of items
(identified by number) that solves the Knapsack problem. It's also worth
outputting the total cost and value of these items. This can all just be printed
and may look something like this (this is *not* a solution, just an example):

```
Items to select: 2, 8, 10
Total cost: 98
Total value: 117
```

For first steps, just think a bit about how you might naively solve this with
brute force. The above data is small enough that such a solution should work, so
give it a go. More to come soon - larger problems that will require more
sophisticated approaches.
